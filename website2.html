    High Profile Cases: Victims of Police Brutality
  </h1>
  <div>
  <h4>
  This website was created by Helena Rajalaingam, a high school student in New York City. The information here exposes the disgusting actions of the American police and their agressiveness towards people of color, specifically Black people. The cases listed here are high profile cases that gained attention from the media. However, it is important to remember that there are many other instances of police brutality that have resulted in physical and emotional injury that have not been documented or recieved media attention.

          Tamir Rice

          <body>
            Tamir Rice was a 12-year-old boy who was shot on on November 22, 2014, in Cleveland, Ohio. Two police officers, 26-year-old Timothy Loehmann and 46-year-old Frank Garmback, were on the scene after receiving a police dispatch call of a black male that "keeps pulling a gun out of his pants and pointing it at people". The caller reported that a male was pointing "a pistol" at random people in the Cudell Recreation Center. At the beginning of the call and again in the middle he says of the pistol "it's probably fake". Toward the end of the two-minute call, the caller stated "he is probably a juvenile". Sadly, this information was not relayed to Loehmann or Garmback on the initial dispatch. The officers reported that upon their arrival, they both continuously yelled "show me your hands" through the open patrol car window. Loehmann further claimed that instead of showing his hands, it appeared as if Rice was trying to draw: "I knew it was a gun and I knew it was coming out". In response, the officer shot twice, hitting Rice once in the torso. He died on the following day.

            "The shooting of Michael Brown occurred on August 9, 2014, in Ferguson, Missouri, a northern suburb of St. Louis. Brown, an 18-year-old African American, walking with a friend in the center of a two way road and was fatally shot by Darren Wilson, a 28-year-old white police officer. Brown was accompanied by his friend Dorian Johnson who was 22.Wilson said that an altercation ensued when Brown attacked Wilson in his police vehicle for control of Wilson's gun until it was fired. Brown and Johnson then fled, with Wilson in pursuit of Brown. Wilson stated that Brown stopped and charged him after a short pursuit. In the entire altercation, Wilson fired a total of twelve bullets, including twice during the struggle in the car; the last was probably the fatal shot. Brown was hit a total of 6 times from the front.

              This event ignited unrest in Ferguson. Although a subsequent FBI investigation found that there was no evidence that Brown had his hands up in surrender or said "don't shoot" before he was shot, protesters rightly believed that he had done so, and used the powerful slogan, "Hands up, don't shoot" in protest. Protests, both peaceful and violent, continued for more than a week in Ferguson; police established a nightly curfew. The response of area police agencies in dealing with the protests was strongly criticized by the media and politicians. There were concerns over insensitivity, tactics, and a militarized response. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon ordered local police organizations to cede much of their authority to the Missouri State Highway Patrol."
